# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical connectivity and functionality issues in the StudioOps AI application. Based on comprehensive codebase analysis and testing, we've identified specific bugs preventing project creation, vendor management, API connectivity, and Trello integration. The goal is to fix these confirmed issues to restore full application functionality.

## Critical Issues Identified

1. **API Server Fragmentation**: Three different API servers with only minimal_api.py working
2. **Database Schema Mismatch**: UUID vs String ID inconsistencies causing 500 errors
3. **Missing Trello MCP**: Empty trello-mcp directory with no implementation
4. **Frontend Connectivity**: API endpoints failing due to schema mismatches
5. **AI Services Issues**: LLM fallback mode and RAG duplicate key errors
6. **Missing Dependencies**: WeasyPrint and other Windows-specific dependency issues

2. WHEN queries are made THEN relevant documents SHALL be retrieved
3. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN they SHALL be stored properly
4. WHEN similarity searches are performed THEN results SHALL be ranked by relevance
5. IF no relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully

### Requirement 5: Memory and Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat sessions and project context to be saved and retrieved, so that conversations maintain continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chat sessions are created THEN they SHALL be assigned unique identifiers
2. WHEN messages are sent THEN they SHALL be stored with proper metadata
3. WHEN sessions are retrieved THEN complete history SHALL be available
4. WHEN project context is provided THEN it SHALL be associated with sessions
5. IF memory limits are reached THEN old sessions SHALL be archived

### Requirement 6: Project Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage projects with AI assistance, so that I can organize my work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN projects are created THEN they SHALL be stored with all required fields
2. WHEN project details are updated THEN changes SHALL be persisted
3. WHEN projects are deleted THEN all associated data SHALL be cleaned up
4. WHEN project lists are requested THEN they SHALL be returned with proper pagination
5. IF project validation fails THEN specific error messages SHALL be provided

### Requirement 7: AI Chat Integration with Projects

**User Story:** As a user, I want to attach AI chat conversations to specific projects, so that project-related discussions are organized and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chats are started within a project THEN they SHALL be linked to that project
2. WHEN project context is available THEN it SHALL influence AI responses
3. WHEN chat history is requested THEN project-specific conversations SHALL be filtered
4. WHEN projects are deleted THEN associated chats SHALL be handled appropriately
5. IF project context changes THEN existing chats SHALL maintain their associations

### Requirement 8: Document and Plan Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save documents and plans to projects, so that all project-related information is centralized and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN they SHALL be associated with projects
2. WHEN plans are generated THEN they SHALL be saved with project context
3. WHEN documents are retrieved THEN proper access control SHALL be enforced
4. WHEN file storage limits are reached THEN appropriate warnings SHALL be shown
5. IF document processing fails THEN error details SHALL be provided

### Requirement 9: Implement Trello MCP Integration

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to export project tasks to Trello boards, so that I can manage tasks in my preferred project management tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trello MCP server is started THEN it SHALL connect successfully
2. WHEN project tasks are exported THEN they SHALL create Trello cards
3. WHEN Trello boards don't exist THEN they SHALL be created automatically
4. WHEN task status changes THEN it SHALL sync with Trello
