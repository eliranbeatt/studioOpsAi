# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a comprehensive analysis and remediation of the StudioOps AI application, focusing on identifying and fixing critical issues across loading, functionality, server connections, API integrations, RAG system, memory management, project management, AI chat functionality, document handling, and Trello MCP integration. The goal is to create a robust, fully functional application with comprehensive testing and analysis capabilities.

### Requirement 5: Memory and Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat sessions and project context to be saved and retrieved, so that conversations maintain continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chat sessions are created THEN they SHALL be assigned unique identifiers
2. WHEN messages are sent THEN they SHALL be stored with proper metadata
3. WHEN sessions are retrieved THEN complete history SHALL be available
4. WHEN project context is provided THEN it SHALL be associated with sessions
5. IF memory limits are reached THEN old sessions SHALL be archived

### Requirement 6: Project Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage projects with AI assistance, so that I can organize my work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN projects are created THEN they SHALL be stored with all required fields
2. WHEN project details are updated THEN changes SHALL be persisted
3. WHEN projects are deleted THEN all associated data SHALL be cleaned up
4. WHEN project lists are requested THEN they SHALL be returned with proper pagination
5. IF project validation fails THEN specific error messages SHALL be provided

### Requirement 7: AI Chat Integration with Projects

**User Story:** As a user, I want to attach AI chat conversations to specific projects, so that project-related discussions are organized and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chats are started within a project THEN they SHALL be linked to that project
2. WHEN project context is available THEN it SHALL influence AI responses
3. WHEN chat history is requested THEN project-specific conversations SHALL be filtered
4. WHEN projects are deleted THEN associated chats SHALL be handled appropriately
5. IF project context changes THEN existing chats SHALL maintain their associations

### Requirement 8: Document and Plan Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save documents and plans to projects, so that all project-related information is centralized and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN they SHALL be associated with projects
2. WHEN plans are generated THEN they SHALL be saved with project context
3. WHEN documents are retrieved THEN proper access control SHALL be enforced
4. WHEN file storage limits are reached THEN appropriate warnings SHALL be shown
5. IF document processing fails THEN error details SHALL be provided

### Requirement 9: Trello MCP Integration

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want tasks to be automatically sent to Trello boards via MCP, so that project management workflows are streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are created THEN they SHALL be sent to configured Trello boards
2. WHEN Trello API credentials are provided THEN they SHALL be validated
3. WHEN MCP server is available THEN it SHALL be used for Trello operations
4. WHEN board structures are needed THEN they SHALL be created automatically
5. IF Trello integration fails THEN fallback options SHALL be available
