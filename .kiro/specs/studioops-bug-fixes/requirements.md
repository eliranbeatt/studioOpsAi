# StudioOps AI Bug Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements to fix all critical bugs and issues preventing the StudioOps AI system from functioning properly. The analysis revealed multiple categories of issues across infrastructure, database, services, APIs, and frontend components that must be addressed to achieve the end-to-end functionality described in the PRD and TDD documents.

The system should enable users to: chat about projects → generate plan skeletons → edit plans → approve plans → generate Hebrew PDFs → create tasks → export to Trello, with proper observability, pricing resolution, and document ingestion capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Infrastructure Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a working local development environment so that I can run and test the StudioOps AI system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `make dev-up` THEN the system SHALL start all required services (Postgres, MinIO, Langfuse, API, Web)
2. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL provide healthy database connections on port 5432
3. WHEN I check service health THEN all containers SHALL report healthy status
4. WHEN I access the API THEN it SHALL respond with proper CORS headers and observability middleware
5. WHEN I run database migrations THEN they SHALL execute without errors and create all required tables

### Requirement 2: Database Schema Consistency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent database schemas so that all services can interact with data properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database migrations run THEN they SHALL create all tables defined in models.py
2. WHEN services query the database THEN column names SHALL match between models and actual schema
3. WHEN foreign key relationships exist THEN they SHALL be properly defined with constraints
4. WHEN extensions are required THEN they SHALL be installed (pgvector, pg_trgm, unaccent, pgcrypto)
5. WHEN seed data is loaded THEN it SHALL populate all reference tables with valid test data

### Requirement 3: Service Layer Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable service layers so that business logic executes without import or runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are imported THEN they SHALL load without missing dependency errors
2. WHEN pricing resolver is called THEN it SHALL return valid price data or graceful fallbacks
3. WHEN estimation service runs THEN it SHALL handle database connection failures gracefully
4. WHEN observability service tracks events THEN it SHALL work with or without Langfuse configuration
5. WHEN error conditions occur THEN services SHALL log appropriately and return meaningful error responses

### Requirement 4: API Completeness

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want complete API endpoints so that I can build functional user interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call project endpoints THEN they SHALL support full CRUD operations
2. WHEN I call plan endpoints THEN they SHALL support creation, editing, approval, and PDF generation
3. WHEN I call chat endpoints THEN they SHALL support streaming responses and context management
4. WHEN I call estimation endpoints THEN they SHALL return accurate pricing and labor estimates
5. WHEN I call document endpoints THEN they SHALL support upload, processing, and retrieval
6. WHEN API schemas are defined THEN they SHALL match between Pydantic models and actual responses

### Requirement 5: Frontend Functionality

**User Story:** As an end user, I want a working web interface so that I can manage projects through the complete workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the home page THEN I SHALL see project management options and working navigation
2. WHEN I start a chat THEN I SHALL be able to send messages and receive AI responses
3. WHEN I create a plan THEN I SHALL see a functional plan editor with live calculations
4. WHEN I edit plan items THEN the system SHALL update totals and validate inputs in real-time
5. WHEN I approve a plan THEN I SHALL be able to generate Hebrew PDF documents
6. WHEN I create tasks THEN I SHALL be able to export them to Trello boards

### Requirement 6: Data Flow Integration

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want seamless data flow between components so that information is consistent across the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I chat about a project THEN the conversation SHALL be saved and retrievable
2. WHEN I create a plan from chat THEN it SHALL use context from the conversation
3. WHEN I price materials THEN the system SHALL use vendor database first, then fallbacks
4. WHEN I generate documents THEN they SHALL include accurate data from the approved plan
5. WHEN I export to Trello THEN tasks SHALL be created with proper project linkage

### Requirement 7: Document Processing Pipeline

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents and have them processed automatically so that pricing and project data is extracted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload documents THEN they SHALL be parsed and classified correctly
2. WHEN documents are processed THEN relevant data SHALL be extracted and stored
3. WHEN extraction confidence is low THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions
4. WHEN I answer clarifications THEN the data SHALL be committed to the database
5. WHEN extracted data exists THEN it SHALL be used in pricing and estimation

### Requirement 8: Observability and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive observability so that I can monitor system health and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations execute THEN they SHALL be traced in Langfuse with proper context
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN metrics SHALL be available to identify bottlenecks
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include trace IDs for correlation
5. WHEN the system is unhealthy THEN health checks SHALL report specific failure reasons

### Requirement 9: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management so that the system works across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults or fail gracefully
2. WHEN database connections fail THEN fallback mechanisms SHALL allow basic functionality
3. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully
4. WHEN secrets are required THEN they SHALL be properly managed and not exposed in logs
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN services SHALL reload without requiring full restart

### Requirement 10: Hebrew Language Support

**User Story:** As an Israeli user, I want proper Hebrew language support so that I can use the system in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the web interface THEN it SHALL display properly in right-to-left (RTL) layout
2. WHEN I generate documents THEN they SHALL support Hebrew text with proper fonts
3. WHEN I enter Hebrew text THEN it SHALL be stored and displayed correctly
4. WHEN currency is displayed THEN it SHALL show NIS (₪) with proper formatting
5. WHEN dates are shown THEN they SHALL support Hebrew month names and local formatting
