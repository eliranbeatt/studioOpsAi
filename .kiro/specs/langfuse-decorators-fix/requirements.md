# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the persistent Langfuse decorators import issue that's preventing the API server from starting. The problem stems from deprecated `langfuse.decorators` imports that no longer exist in the current Langfuse version (v3.3.4+). This spec will systematically identify, fix, and prevent all decorator-related import issues to ensure the API server starts reliably.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API server to start without Langfuse import errors, so that I can develop and test the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API server is started THEN the system SHALL NOT encounter any `ModuleNotFoundError` related to `langfuse.decorators`
2. WHEN the observability service is imported THEN the system SHALL use only supported Langfuse v3.3.4+ API methods
3. WHEN any file imports Langfuse functionality THEN the system SHALL use the correct import paths and methods

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Langfuse integrations to use the current API, so that observability features work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracing is enabled THEN the system SHALL use `langfuse.trace()` instead of deprecated decorators
2. WHEN creating spans THEN the system SHALL use `langfuse.span()` instead of deprecated decorators
3. WHEN accessing context THEN the system SHALL use `langfuse.get_current_trace()` instead of `langfuse_context`
4. WHEN observing functions THEN the system SHALL use the new Langfuse API methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive detection of all decorator imports, so that no hidden imports cause future failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify ALL files containing `langfuse.decorators` imports
2. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify ALL files containing `from langfuse.decorators` imports
3. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify ALL usage of deprecated decorator functions like `@observe`
4. WHEN scanning is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a complete inventory of files requiring updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated import statements and function calls, so that all Langfuse functionality uses the supported API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL replace `from langfuse.decorators import observe, langfuse_context` with `from langfuse import Langfuse`
2. WHEN updating function decorators THEN the system SHALL replace `@observe` with appropriate `langfuse.trace()` or `langfuse.span()` calls
3. WHEN updating context access THEN the system SHALL replace `langfuse_context` usage with `langfuse.get_current_trace()`
4. WHEN updating is complete THEN all Langfuse functionality SHALL work with the current API version

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validation that all fixes work correctly, so that the API server starts and observability functions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all fixes are applied THEN the API server SHALL start without import errors
2. WHEN the observability service is used THEN tracing SHALL work correctly with the new API
3. WHEN running tests THEN all Langfuse-related functionality SHALL pass validation
4. WHEN the server is restarted THEN no cached import issues SHALL persist

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want prevention measures for future decorator issues, so that this problem doesn't recur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new Langfuse imports THEN the system SHALL enforce use of supported API methods
2. WHEN the Langfuse version is updated THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility with existing code
3. WHEN code reviews are conducted THEN deprecated import patterns SHALL be flagged
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the correct Langfuse API usage patterns
