# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to permanently resolve the Langfuse decorators import issue by addressing the root cause (Python cache contamination) and implementing robust prevention measures.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Comprehensive Cache Cleanup and Process Management
  - Stop all running Python processes and clear all cached bytecode files
  - Kill any uvicorn processes that might be holding stale imports
  - Remove all `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files from the entire project
  - Clear virtual environment caches that might contain stale imports
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 2. Import Chain Validation and Verification
  - Scan entire codebase for any remaining `langfuse.decorators` imports
  - Verify all Langfuse imports use the correct `from langfuse import Langfuse` pattern
  - Validate that observability service uses only supported Langfuse v3.3.4+ API methods
  - Check all dependent files (routers, middleware, tests) for correct import usage
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 3. Clean Server Restart and Functionality Testing
  - Restart API server with completely clean environment
  - Test that server starts without any ModuleNotFoundError related to langfuse.decorators
  - Verify observability service initializes correctly with new Langfuse API
  - Test all observability functions (create_trace, create_span, create_event, track_error)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.4, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 4. Dependency Integration Testing
  - Test all files that import observability service work correctly
  - Verify OCR router observability integration functions properly
  - Verify Unstructured router observability integration functions properly
  - Test observability middleware works with new API methods
  - Run observability test suite to ensure all functionality works
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 5. Prevention and Monitoring Implementation
  - Add cache cleanup to development workflow documentation
  - Create validation script to check for deprecated Langfuse imports
  - Implement automated cache clearing in CI/CD pipeline
  - Add monitoring for Langfuse import errors in server logs
  - Document correct Langfuse API usage patterns for future development
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 6. Final Validation and Documentation
  - Run comprehensive test suite to ensure all Langfuse functionality works
  - Verify server can be restarted multiple times without import issues
  - Test that observability traces appear correctly in Langfuse dashboard
  - Document the resolution process and prevention measures
  - Create troubleshooting guide for future Langfuse issues
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.4_
