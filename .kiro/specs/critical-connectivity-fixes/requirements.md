# Critical Connectivity Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Based on comprehensive codebase analysis and testing, this specification addresses the remaining critical issues preventing full application functionality. The API server dependency issues have been resolved, but database connectivity, Trello integration, and AI services still need fixes.

## Confirmed Critical Issues

1. **Database Connectivity**: PostgreSQL not running, preventing all database operations
2. **Trello MCP Missing**: Complete absence of Trello integration implementation  
3. **RAG System Errors**: Duplicate key violations during initialization
4. **Frontend Integration**: API endpoints need testing with frontend after database fixes
5. **AI Services**: OpenAI integration disabled, using fallback responses

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Service Restoration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the database to be accessible so that I can create and manage projects, vendors, and all application data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker Desktop is started THEN PostgreSQL container SHALL start successfully
2. WHEN the API server connects to database THEN connection SHALL be established without errors
3. WHEN projects endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return project data from database
4. WHEN new projects are created THEN they SHALL be saved to database with proper UUID handling
5. IF database connection fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided

### Requirement 2: Complete Trello MCP Integration

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to export project tasks to Trello boards so that I can manage tasks in my preferred project management tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Trello MCP server is implemented THEN it SHALL provide task export functionality
2. WHEN project tasks are exported THEN they SHALL create corresponding Trello cards
3. WHEN Trello boards don't exist THEN they SHALL be created automatically
4. WHEN task status changes THEN it SHALL optionally sync with Trello
5. IF Trello API credentials are invalid THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided

### Requirement 3: Fix RAG System Initialization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the RAG system to initialize without errors so that document processing and AI context work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RAG system initializes THEN it SHALL check for existing documents before insertion
2. WHEN duplicate documents are detected THEN they SHALL be skipped gracefully
3. WHEN new documents are added THEN they SHALL be processed and indexed correctly
4. WHEN document searches are performed THEN relevant results SHALL be returned
5. IF ChromaDB operations fail THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 4: Enable Real OpenAI Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want real AI responses from OpenAI so that chat functionality provides intelligent assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenAI API key is configured THEN real AI responses SHALL be enabled
2. WHEN chat messages are sent THEN OpenAI API SHALL be called successfully
3. WHEN API responses are received THEN they SHALL be properly formatted and returned
4. WHEN conversation history exists THEN it SHALL be included in context
5. IF OpenAI API fails THEN fallback responses SHALL be used temporarily

### Requirement 5: Frontend-Backend Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web interface to work seamlessly with the API so that I can manage projects through the UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web app loads THEN it SHALL connect to API successfully
2. WHEN projects are displayed THEN they SHALL load from database via API
3. WHEN new projects are created via UI THEN they SHALL be saved to database
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN user-friendly error messages SHALL be displayed
5. IF API is unavailable THEN appropriate offline messaging SHALL be shown

### Requirement 6: End-to-End Workflow Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want complete workflows to function properly so that I can use the application for real project management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a complete project workflow is executed THEN all components SHALL work together
2. WHEN projects are created THEN they SHALL be available for chat, planning, and export
3. WHEN AI chat is used THEN it SHALL provide contextual responses with memory
4. WHEN plans are generated THEN they SHALL be exportable to Trello
5. IF any workflow step fails THEN clear error reporting SHALL be provided

## Success Criteria

- Database connectivity restored and all CRUD operations working
- Trello MCP server implemented with basic task export functionality
- RAG system initializing without errors
- OpenAI integration enabled with real AI responses
- Frontend successfully connecting to and using all API endpoints
- Complete project creation to Trello export workflow functional
