# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive test plan for the StudioOps AI system that addresses critical testing gaps and ensures robust functionality across all components. The system currently has fragmented testing with several failing tests and missing coverage areas. This spec will establish a systematic testing framework that covers UI components, API endpoints, database functionality, configuration management, and the Langfuse observability integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all UI components, so that I can ensure reliable user interface functionality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running component tests THEN the system SHALL test all React components including Chat, PlanEditor, ProjectForm, VendorForm, MaterialForm, and Sidebar
2. WHEN testing component interactions THEN the system SHALL verify button clicks, form submissions, modal openings, and navigation functionality
3. WHEN testing component state management THEN the system SHALL validate state updates, prop passing, and context usage
4. WHEN testing component rendering THEN the system SHALL ensure proper display of data, error states, and loading states
5. WHEN testing component accessibility THEN the system SHALL verify ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API endpoint testing, so that I can ensure all backend services function correctly and handle edge cases properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL test all routes including /health, /api/health, /vendors, /materials, /projects, /plans, /chat, and /estimation
2. WHEN testing API responses THEN the system SHALL verify correct status codes, response formats, and data validation
3. WHEN testing API error handling THEN the system SHALL validate proper error responses for invalid inputs, missing data, and server errors
4. WHEN testing API authentication THEN the system SHALL verify protected routes require proper authentication
5. WHEN testing API performance THEN the system SHALL measure response times and validate acceptable performance thresholds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive database functionality testing, so that I can ensure data persistence, integrity, and proper CRUD operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing database connections THEN the system SHALL verify successful connection establishment and proper error handling for connection failures
2. WHEN testing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL validate Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for all entities (projects, vendors, materials, plans)
3. WHEN testing data persistence THEN the system SHALL ensure data survives server restarts and maintains consistency
4. WHEN testing database transactions THEN the system SHALL verify proper rollback on errors and atomicity of operations
5. WHEN testing database constraints THEN the system SHALL validate foreign key relationships, unique constraints, and data validation rules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive configuration and environment testing, so that I can ensure the system works correctly across different deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing configuration loading THEN the system SHALL verify proper loading of environment variables and configuration files
2. WHEN testing configuration validation THEN the system SHALL validate required configurations are present and properly formatted
3. WHEN testing configuration persistence THEN the system SHALL ensure configuration changes are saved and loaded correctly
4. WHEN testing environment-specific behavior THEN the system SHALL verify different behavior in development, testing, and production environments
5. WHEN testing configuration security THEN the system SHALL ensure sensitive configuration data is properly protected

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive Langfuse observability testing, so that I can ensure monitoring and tracing functionality works correctly without import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing Langfuse integration THEN the system SHALL verify successful initialization without ModuleNotFoundError or import issues
2. WHEN testing trace creation THEN the system SHALL validate trace creation, span creation, and event logging functionality
3. WHEN testing observability middleware THEN the system SHALL ensure proper request tracing and performance monitoring
4. WHEN testing error tracking THEN the system SHALL verify error capture, context preservation, and proper error reporting
5. WHEN testing observability configuration THEN the system SHALL validate proper setup with and without Langfuse credentials

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration testing between frontend and backend, so that I can ensure end-to-end functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing project workflows THEN the system SHALL verify complete project creation, editing, and deletion flows
2. WHEN testing chat functionality THEN the system SHALL validate message sending, AI responses, and plan generation
3. WHEN testing data synchronization THEN the system SHALL ensure frontend and backend data consistency
4. WHEN testing real-time features THEN the system SHALL verify WebSocket connections and live updates
5. WHEN testing cross-component integration THEN the system SHALL validate data flow between different UI components

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and load testing, so that I can ensure the system handles expected user loads and maintains acceptable response times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API performance THEN the system SHALL measure and validate response times under normal load
2. WHEN testing database performance THEN the system SHALL verify query performance and connection pooling efficiency
3. WHEN testing frontend performance THEN the system SHALL measure page load times, component render times, and bundle sizes
4. WHEN testing concurrent users THEN the system SHALL validate system behavior under multiple simultaneous users
5. WHEN testing resource usage THEN the system SHALL monitor memory usage, CPU utilization, and network bandwidth

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test execution and reporting, so that I can ensure tests run consistently and provide clear feedback on system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running automated tests THEN the system SHALL execute all test suites and provide comprehensive reports
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages, stack traces, and debugging information
3. WHEN generating test reports THEN the system SHALL include coverage metrics, performance data, and trend analysis
4. WHEN integrating with CI/CD THEN the system SHALL run tests automatically on code changes and deployment
5. WHEN managing test data THEN the system SHALL provide proper test data setup, cleanup, and isolation between tests
