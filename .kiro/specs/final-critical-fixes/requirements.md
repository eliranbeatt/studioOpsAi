# Requirements Document - Final Critical System Fixes

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical system issues identified in the StudioOps AI application, including foreign key constraint violations during project deletion, Trello MCP connectivity problems, context upload failures, and AI response mockup issues. These problems prevent the system from functioning properly in production and development environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Foreign Key Constraint Resolution

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to be able to delete projects without encountering foreign key constraint violations, so that data management operations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to delete a project THEN the system SHALL handle all dependent records appropriately
2. WHEN chat_sessions reference a project THEN the system SHALL either cascade delete or set foreign keys to NULL
3. WHEN documents reference a project THEN the system SHALL handle the relationship properly during deletion
4. WHEN plans reference a project THEN the system SHALL cascade delete as currently configured
5. WHEN purchases reference a project THEN the system SHALL handle the relationship during deletion
6. IF foreign key constraints exist THEN the system SHALL provide proper ON DELETE actions for all relationships

### Requirement 2: Trello MCP Server Connectivity Fix

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want the Trello integration to work properly, so that I can export project tasks to Trello boards seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trello MCP server starts THEN it SHALL properly initialize with valid API credentials
2. WHEN API credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and graceful degradation
3. WHEN creating Trello boards THEN the system SHALL successfully communicate with Trello API
4. WHEN exporting project tasks THEN the system SHALL create boards, lists, and cards correctly
5. IF Trello API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and retry logic
6. WHEN testing MCP integration THEN all connection tests SHALL pass

### Requirement 3: Context Upload and Document Processing Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to upload documents and context files successfully, so that the AI can process and analyze project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL store files in MinIO object storage successfully
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the ingestion pipeline SHALL extract text and metadata correctly
3. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL create proper database records with correct relationships
4. WHEN the AI processes context THEN it SHALL access uploaded documents and generate appropriate responses
5. IF upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and cleanup partial uploads
6. WHEN documents are processed THEN they SHALL be available for AI context and search

### Requirement 4: AI Response System Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to provide real, helpful responses instead of mockup answers, so that I can get actual assistance with my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI service is available THEN the system SHALL use real LLM responses instead of mock data
2. WHEN the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to informative mock responses
3. WHEN users ask questions THEN the AI SHALL provide contextually relevant answers based on project data
4. WHEN generating project plans THEN the AI SHALL create realistic, actionable plans with proper cost estimates
5. IF AI services fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear status indicators and fallback functionality
6. WHEN AI responses are generated THEN they SHALL be logged and monitored for quality

### Requirement 5: System Integration and Connectivity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all system components to communicate properly, so that the application functions as an integrated whole.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web frontend starts THEN it SHALL successfully connect to the API backend
2. WHEN the API starts THEN it SHALL successfully connect to the database and external services
3. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate status indicators
4. WHEN database migrations run THEN they SHALL complete successfully without data loss
5. IF any service fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and recovery guidance
6. WHEN the system is healthy THEN all health check endpoints SHALL return success status

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and graceful error handling, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages in appropriate language
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback transactions and maintain data integrity
3. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function with reduced capabilities
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight specific fields and provide correction guidance
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
6. WHEN users encounter errors THEN they SHALL have clear paths to resolution or support
