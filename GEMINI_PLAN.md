# Project: StudioOps AI - E2E Test Suite Remediation and System Stabilization

## 1. Requirements Document

### 1.1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the project to remediate the end-to-end (E2E) test suite and stabilize the StudioOps AI platform. The current E2E test suite is exhibiting a 100% failure rate, with numerous timeouts and assertion failures across all supported browsers and devices. The application itself appears to be unstable, frequently rendering 404 pages or displaying a disconnected state. This project aims to identify the root causes of these failures, implement robust solutions, and establish a stable and reliable E2E testing process and a stable application.

### 1.2. Business Goals

*   **BG-1:** Increase confidence in the quality and stability of the StudioOps AI platform.
*   **BG-2:** Reduce the time and effort required for manual regression testing.
*   **BG-3:** Accelerate the development and deployment lifecycle by enabling faster feedback on code changes.
*   **BG-4:** Improve the overall developer experience by providing a reliable and efficient testing process.
*   **BG-5:** Ensure the application is stable and usable for end-users.

### 1.3. Functional Requirements

*   **FR-1:** The E2E test suite shall achieve a pass rate of at least 99% across all supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit) and devices (desktop, mobile).
*   **FR-2:** The E2E test suite shall generate a detailed HTML report for each test run, including screenshots and videos for failed tests.
*   **FR-3:** The E2E test suite shall have a total execution time of under 15 minutes.
*   **FR-4:** The E2E test suite shall be integrated into the GitHub Actions CI pipeline, with automated test runs triggered on every push to the `main` branch.
*   **FR-5:** The E2E test suite shall follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
*   **FR-6:** The application shall be stable and shall not render 404 pages for valid routes.
*   **FR-7:** The application shall maintain a stable connection to the backend server.

### 1.4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-1:** The E2E test suite shall have a flake rate of less than 1%.
*   **NFR-2:** The E2E test suite shall be designed to be easily extensible, with a clear process for adding new tests.
*   **NFR-3:** The E2E test suite shall have a dedicated `README.md` file that provides clear instructions on how to run the tests, interpret the results, and debug failures.

## 2. Critique and Revised Requirements

### 2.1. Critique

The initial requirements document provides a good starting point, but it could be improved in the following areas:

*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The requirements focus on fixing the E2E tests, but they don't address the underlying stability issues with the application. The plan should include a thorough root cause analysis to identify and fix the source of the instability.
*   **Prioritization:** The requirements are not prioritized. It's important to prioritize the fixes to ensure that the most critical issues are addressed first.
*   **Phased Approach:** The project should be broken down into phases to allow for incremental progress and feedback.

### 2.2. Revised Requirements

Here is a revised version of the requirements document that addresses the issues identified above:

#### 2.2.1. Phase 1: System Stabilization

*   **P1-FR-1:** Identify and fix the root cause of the application instability, including the 404 errors and the disconnected server state.
*   **P1-FR-2:** Ensure that the application is stable and usable for end-users.
*   **P1-FR-3:** Create a new set of focused E2E tests to verify the stability of the application.

#### 2.2.2. Phase 2: E2E Test Suite Remediation

*   **P2-FR-1:** Remediate the existing E2E test suite to achieve a pass rate of at least 99% across all supported browsers and devices.
*   **P2-FR-2:** Optimize the E2E test suite for performance, with a target execution time of under 15 minutes.
*   **P2-FR-3:** Integrate the E2E test suite into the CI pipeline.

## 3. TDD Design Document

### 3.1. Overview

This document outlines the design for the E2E test suite remediation and system stabilization project, following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. We will start by writing failing tests that capture the current issues, and then we will implement the necessary fixes to make the tests pass.

### 3.2. Test Plan

We will create a new Playwright test file called `e2e-stabilization.spec.ts` to house the tests for the system stabilization phase. The tests will be organized into the following categories:

*   **Smoke Tests:** A small set of high-level tests that verify the basic functionality of the application.
*   **Stability Tests:** Tests that are designed to identify and reproduce the stability issues with the application.

### 3.3. Test Cases

Here are some of the test cases that we will implement:

#### 3.3.1. Smoke Tests

*   `should load the home page without any errors`
*   `should display the main navigation menu`
*   `should be able to navigate to the projects page`

#### 3.3.2. Stability Tests

*   `should not render a 404 page for valid routes`
*   `should maintain a stable connection to the backend server`
