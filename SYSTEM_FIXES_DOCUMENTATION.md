- Implemented configuration validation service
- Added CLI configuration management tools
- Enhanced startup validation with configuration checks

**Files Created**:
- `.env.template` - Main configuration template
- `.env.development` - Development configuration
- `.env.production` - Production configuration
- `apps/api/services/config_validation_service.py` - Configuration validation
- `config_manager.py` - CLI configuration tool
